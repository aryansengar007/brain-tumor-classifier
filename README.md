# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification Using Deep Learning
*A Streamlit-based AI Tool for Medical Image Diagnosis*

## 📌 Description
This project is a deep learning-powered web application for classifying brain MRI/CT images as **Healthy** or **Tumor**. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on medical images and provides an intuitive Streamlit interface with support for batch classification, contrast enhancement, and downloadable diagnostic reports in PDF format.
